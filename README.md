Interview Questions:

1. What are the key elements of a dashboard?
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Visualizations (charts, graphs)

Filters/Slicers for interactivity

Clear layout and titles

Consistent color theme

2. What is a KPI?
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable value that shows how effectively a business is achieving its objectives — e.g., Sales, Profit, or Customer Retention.

3. What are slicers in Power BI?
Slicers are visual filters that allow users to dynamically filter data by fields like Region, Category, or Date — making dashboards interactive and user-friendly.

Company    	  Microsoft	                              Salesforce
Ease of Use	  Easier for beginners                  	Steeper learning curve
Cost	        More affordable                         More expensive
Data Handling	Good for MS tools (Excel, SQL)         	Better for large, complex data
Visuals	      Rich but more structured	              Very flexible and powerful visuals

5. How do you make a dashboard interactive?
Use Slicers and Filters

Add Drill-through pages

Use Tooltips and Hover Cards

Create Bookmarks and Buttons for navigation

6. How do you deal with large datasets in dashboards?
Use Aggregations instead of detailed data

Pre-process data (Power Query, SQL)

Use data modeling to reduce redundancy

Apply filters or row-level security

Avoid too many visuals on one page

Line Chart (best for continuous time data)

Area Chart (shows volume and trend)

Combo Chart (compare two measures over time)
